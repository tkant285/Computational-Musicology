# Computational-Musicology

My corpus focuses on how has jazz evolved over the eras, starting from the 1920s. I picked this corpus because the origin of the genre and the multitude of strong cultural backgrounds tied to it piqued my interest. It will be interesting to explore the differences in the genre throughout the different ages of jazz, as well as how the abundance of sub-genres began to sprout from said eras as groups of comparison. I also like how there are a variety of instruments used in jazz, and different combinations of different instruments produce unique sounds. I expect some differences to be found in how the culture of the given time period, as well as sub-genre influence, affects the overall sound of that era in terms of tempo and chords. I expect for there to be an underlying similar rhythm maintained. There is a ridiculous amount of diversity in the world of jazz music on Spotify. I will have to find the specific sound of each decade and compare those, otherwise it is risky to get lost in the sea of sub-genres that exist within the genre.
